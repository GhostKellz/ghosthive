### Project Concept: GhostHive - Machine Learning Framework
**Functionality:** Neural networks, training, inference, model deployment
- Tensor operations with N-dimensional arrays, automatic differentiation
- Neural network layers, activations, optimizers, loss functions
- Model import/export (ONNX), custom serialization formats
- Multiple backends (CPU SIMD, GPU compute shaders, accelerators)
- Distributed training, gradient descent, backpropagation


7. GhostHive â€“ Machine Learning Framework

Why: Ambitious, but long-term transformative. Heavy lift, but would make Zig attractive for AI.
Impact: ðŸ¤– High potential, but later phase (once fundamentals are in place).
